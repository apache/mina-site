# Reporting a Bug

We are using JIRA to track all FtpServer issues including bugs. Please visit our [issue tracker page](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FTPSERVER) to report a bug. 

## How to report a bug

Writing a bug report with detailed information will help us to fix your problem sooner.

* Make sure if the bug you are going to report doesn't exist yet.
* Attaching JUnit test case which reproduces the problem will put your report in our highest priority.
* Attach full thread stack dump if you suspect a dead lock.
* Attach full heap dump if you suspect a memory leak.
* Specify the environment in detail as much as possible.
    * Operating system version, distribution, architecture, ...
    * JVM vendor, version, build number, command line arguments, ...
    * Network settings
