# Getting Involved

Apache FtpServer communicates using our [Mailing Lists](mailing_list.html). If you have any questions, feedback or suggestions, you're very welcome to join the list and send an email. We are also happy to receive [bug reports and feature requests in our JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FTPSERVER).

# Patches

The best chance of getting your bug or feature fixed is to provide a patch, if they fit our goals we will usually have them committed within a few days. The Apache Contributors page has excellent [information on how to produce patches](http://apache.org/dev/contributors.html#patches).
