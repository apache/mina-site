# Welcome to Apache MINA

## Overview

Apache  <abbr title="Multipurpose Infrastructure for Network Applications">MINA</abbr> is a network application framework which helps users develop high performance and high scalability network applications easily.  It provides an abstract &middot;event-driven &middot; asynchronous API over various transports such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP via Java NIO.

Apache MINA is often called:

* NIO framework &middot; library,
* client &middot; server framework &middot; library, or
* a networking &middot; socket library.

However, it's much more than that.  Please take a look around the list of the *[features](features.html)* that enable rapid network application development, and *[what people says about MINA](testimonials.html)*.
