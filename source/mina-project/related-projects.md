### [Grizzly](https://grizzly.java.net/)

Grizzly framework has been designed to help developers to take advantage of the Javaâ„¢ NIO API. Originally developed under the GlassFish umbrella, the framework is now available as a standalone project. Grizzly goals is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers using NIO.

### [Netty 3](http://www.jboss.org/netty/)

The new version of Netty Trustin Lee is working on now. The Netty project is an effort to provide an asynchronous event-driven network application framework and tools for rapid development of maintainable high performance and high scalability protocol servers and clients.

### [NIO Framework](http://nioframework.sourceforge.net/)

The NIO Framework is a library on top of NIO that hides most of the complexity of plain NIO. With the NIO Framework you can implement high-performance Java network applications without having to deal with all the nasty details of NIO. The issues above are resolved while the performance is preserved.

### [QuickServer](http://www.quickserver.org/)

QuickServer is an open source Java library/framework for quick creation of robust multi-client TCP server applications. QuickServer provides an abstraction over the ServerSocket, Socket and other network and input output classes and it eases the creation of powerful network servers.

### [xSocket](http://xsocket.sourceforge.net/)

xSocket is a easy to use NIO-based library to build high performance, highly scalable network applications. It supports writing client-side applications as well as server-side applications in an intuitive way. Issues like low level NIO selector programming, connection pool management, connection timeout detection or fragmented buffer reads are encapsulated by xSocket.

## Messaging

### [Apache Camel](http://activemq.apache.org/camel/)
