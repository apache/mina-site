title: Apache MINA Mailing Lists
---

The Apache MINA team interacts with MINA developers and users via [mailing lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list). If you have any questions or something to say to us, please subscribe to our user mailing list and post a message. If you would like to contribute to the development of MINA, please subscribe to the developer mailing list.

__Do NOT cross post (ie mail to users and dev). Pick the right list__

Take a few minutes to read this page :[Asking Smart Questions](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

More specifically, follow those simple rules :

* Do not cross post (ie mail to users and dev). Pick the right list.
* No need to send a mail every hour if you don't get an answer. We don't have an answer to every question ...
* Use meaningful subject headers. HELP PLEASE HELP ME is just plain useless...
* Be precise about your problem.
* Always give some information about the version you are using, the OS, the Java version.
* You may have find a bug in MINA, but it's way more likely that your code is buggy.
* Don't be afraid to post, even if you think your english suck. Most of us are not english native speakers, anyways ...

Thanks for listening !
