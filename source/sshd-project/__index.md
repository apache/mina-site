# Overview

Apache SSHD is a 100% pure java library to support the SSH protocols on both the client and server side.
This library is based on [Apache MINA](http://mina.apache.org/), a scalable and high performance asynchronous IO library.

SSHD does not really aim at being a replacement for the SSH client or SSH server from Unix operating systems, but rather provides support for Java based applications requiring SSH support.
