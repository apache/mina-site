# Building SSHD

SSHD uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as its build tool. If you don't fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or Download a distribution or JAR.

* Download and [install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation).
* Get the latest code from [Git](sources.html)
* Build the code with the following command

        mvn clean install
