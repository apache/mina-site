Abstract

    This document specifies two additions to the File Transfer Protocol
    (FTP).  These additions (new Server commands) would give FTP 
    Servers the ability to generate (or otherwise obtain) and return 
    MD5 checksums for the files it has available for transfer.

    It is the author&#39;s belief that this would provide a great benefit
    to the Internet community, because it would allow automated
    transfer agents, as well as Web Browsers and other
    &#34;click-to-download&#34; applications to be able to automatically verify
    the data of a downloaded file, and hence be able to detect any data
    tampering and/or corruption that may occurred while &#34;on the wire&#34;,
    or possibly while the file was on the Server (a virus infection).

INTERNET-DRAFT   The &#39;MD5&#39; and &#34;MMD5&#34; FTP Command Extensions   May 2002

1.  Introduction

    This Draft is being distributed to members of the Internet
    community in order to solicit their reactions to the proposals
    contained in it.
    
    
2.  Rational

   FTP is still very much in use on the Internet.  These days, some
   servers make available files that contain the checksums for some of
   the files that are available.  These available checksums allow
   users to be able to verify the content of the files that they have
   downloaded.
   
   However, this introduces some additional overhead: these MD5
   checksums must be manually generated, put into a file, the file
   placed where it can be accessed.  Then, users must manually
   download the file containing the checksum, generate an MD5 checksum
   from the file they just downloaded, and (usually) visually compare
   the two checksums to determine the validity of the file.
   
   Having these tasks automated, by making the MD5 checksums available
   directly from the FTP Server proper, and having file-transfer
   implementations use them, alleviates some of the user intervention
   that would otherwise be required.
   
   
3.  Server Requirements

   FTP Servers would have to implement a new server-side command,
   called &#34;MD5&#34;, this command would normally generate and return a
   MD5 for the specified file.
   
   Optionally, the FTP Server could also implement the &#34;MMD5&#34; command,
   which is used to obtain MD5 checksums for multiple files using a
   single request.
   
   (These commands impose no specific or additional syntax on the 
   formatting of a filepath, they use the Server&#39;s existing 
   conventions.)
    
   The Server implementation is also free to use some form of
   caching to keep the generated MD5 checksums, so that the MD5
   checksum values do not have to be regenerated over and over again
   when requested.
   
   This also allows the Server implementations to maintain some level
   of security: the Server can expose administrative commands that
   regenerate the cache of MD5 checksums on command, thus allowing
   for &#34;known good&#34; checksums to be kept, and would be insensitive to
   things like the file becoming corrupted or otherwise tampered with
   after the &#34;known good&#34; MD5 checksum was generated.
   
   
J.Twine                      Internet-Draft                   [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT   The &#39;MD5&#39; and &#34;MMD5&#34; FTP Command Extensions   May 2002

   A Server implementation could even take that approach one step
   further: by generating additional MD5 checksums &#34;on the fly&#34; and
   comparing them to the &#34;known good&#34; values that were stored earlier,
   the Server would now have the ability to detect file corruption
   and/or tampering earlier than the user would normally discover.
   
   The command would support a full or relative path, so that a
   directory change would not be necessary in order to obtain the
   MD5 checksum of a particular file.  Of course, the command
   should normally be restricted to the directory tree and/or files
   that the connected user would normally have access to.
   
   
3.1 Command Format (MD5)

   The &#34;MD5&#34; command is used to obtain a MD5 checksum for a single
   file, and is specified as follows:
   
      MD5 [Filepath]
      
   Possible responses to this command would normally include:
   
   251 [FilePath] E67DED2886048D308532042B777D53CF
   500 Command Not Recognized
   502 Command Not Implemented
   504 Command Not Implemented for the Specified Argument
   
   (Note that the returned MD5 checksum is in UPPERCASE.)
   
   A successful response of &#34;251&#34; would contain the specified 
   filepath (verbatim) followed by a space (or some amount of 
   whitespace), and then followed by the MD5 checksum value in
   ASCII format.
   
   An error return of &#34;500&#34; would be for an obvious reason: the FTP 
   Server does not recognize the &#34;MD5&#34; command.
   
   An error return of &#34;502&#34; would be appropriate if the FTP Server
   recognized the command, but did not support it, or the FTP Server
   administrator disabled it.
   
   An error return of &#34;504&#34; would be appropriate if the user requested
   an MD5 checksum for a directory (for example).
   
3.1.1 MD5 Examples

   This first example demonstrates a request for a MD5 checksum of a 
   single file (&#34;C&gt;&#34; is Client input, and &#34;S&gt;&#34; is Server response):

      C&gt; MD5 filename.ext
      S&gt; 251 filename.ext E67DED2886048D308532042B777D53CF
  
   This second example demonstrates a request for a MD5 checksum of a
   directory:

INTERNET-DRAFT   The &#39;MD5&#39; and &#34;MMD5&#34; FTP Command Extensions   May 2002

        C&gt; MD5 &#34;..&#34;
        S&gt; 504 Command Not Implemented for the Specified Argument
   
   
   This third example demonstrates a request for a MD5 checksum of a
   file using a relative path:
    
      C&gt; MD5 &#34;../SomeDir/A File.txt&#34;
      S&gt; 251 &#34;../SomeDir/A File.txt&#34; 604E67DED8D308B777D53CF532042288
      
3.2 Command Format (MMD5)

   The &#34;MMD5&#34; command is used to obtain MD5 checksums for multiple
   files by a single request.  Filepaths are comma separated, and are
   specified as follows (it is to be considered valid to specify a 
   single filepath with with MMD5 command):
   
      MMD5 [Filepath1], [Filepath2] [...]
      
   Possible responses to this command would normally include:
   
      252 [FilePath1] E67DED2886048D308532042B777D53CF,[Filepath2]
         308536048D20E67D77D53CFED28842B7 [...]
      500 Command Not Recognized
      502 Command Not Implemented
      504 Command Not Implemented for the Specified Argument

   A successful response of &#34;252&#34; would contain comma separated 
   &#34;groups&#34; of MD5 checksum information.  Each group would contain the
   specified filepath (verbatim) followed by a space (or some amount
   of whitespace) followed by the MD5 checksum value in
   ASCII format.
   
   An error return of &#34;500&#34; would be the same as described for the &#34;MD5&#34; 
   command.

   An error return of &#34;502&#34; would be appropriate if the &#34;MMD5&#34; command
   was not implemented or disabled.
   
   An error return of &#34;504&#34; would be the same as described form the &#34;MD5&#34;
   command, with this exception: of any of the specified filepaths were
   invalid, the server would return this error code (i.e. it would 
   no MD5 checksums at all). 
   
   
3.2.1 MMD5 Examples

    This first example demonstrates a request for a MD5 checksum of a 
    single file:
    
      C&gt; MMD5 filename.ext
      S&gt; 251 filename.ext E67DED2886048D308532042B777D53CF

INTERNET-DRAFT   The &#39;MD5&#39; and &#34;MMD5&#34; FTP Command Extensions   May 2002

    This second example demonstrates a request for the MD5 checksums 
    for two files:
  
        C&gt; MMD5 filename.ext, &#34;../SomeDir/A File.txt&#34;
        S&gt; 252 filename.ext E67DED2886048D308532042B777D53CF, 
            &#34;../SomeDir/A File.txt&#34; 604E67DED8D308B777D53CF532042288


    This third example demonstrates a request for the MD5 checksums of
    a file and a directory:
  
      C&gt; MD5 filename.ext, &#34;..&#34;
      S&gt; 504 Command Not Implemented for the Specified Argument
