# Features

MINA is a simple yet full-featured network application framework which provides:

* Unified API for various transport types:
	* TCP/IP & UDP/IP via Java NIO
	* Serial communication (RS232) via RXTX
	* In-VM pipe communication
	* You can implement your own!
* Filter interface as an extension point; similar to Servlet filters
* Low-level and high-level API:
	* Low-level: uses ByteBuffers
	* High-level: uses user-defined message objects and codecs
* Highly customizable thread model:
	* Single thread
	* One thread pool
	* More than one thread pools (i.e. [SEDA](https://web.archive.org/web/20061208181754/http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/papers/mdw-phdthesis.pdf))
* Out-of-the-box SSL &middot; TLS &middot; StartTLS support using Java 5 `SSLEngine`
* Overload shielding & traffic throttling
* Unit testability using mock objects
* JMX managability
* Stream-based I/O support via `StreamIoHandler`
* Integration with well known containers such as PicoContainer and Spring
* Smooth migration from Netty, an ancestor of Apache MINA.
