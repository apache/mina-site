      <title>1.1 - NIO Overview</title>

      <description>NIO Overview The NIO API was introduced in Java 1.4 and had since been used for wide number of applications. The NIO API covers IO non-blocking operations.
First of all, it&#39;s good to know that MINA is written on top of NIO 1. A new version has been designed in Java 7, NIO-2, we don&#39;t yet benefit from the added features this version is carrying.  It&#39;s also important to know that the N in NIO means New, but we will use the Non-Blocking term in many places.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch1-getting-started/ch1.2-why-mina.html</guid>
      <description>Why MINA? Writing network applications are generally seen as a burden and perceived as low level development. It is an area which is not frequently studied or known by developers, either because it has been studied in school a long time ago and everything has been forgotten, or because the complexity of the network layer is frequently hidden by higher level layers, so you never get deep into it.
Added to that (when it comes to asynchronous IO) an extra layer of complexity comes into play: time.</description>

      <title>2.1 - Application Architecture</title>
      <link>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch2-basics/ch2.1-application-architecture.html</link>

      <description>2.1.1 - Server Architecture 2.1.2 - Client Architecture  2.1 - MINA based Application Architecture It&amp;rsquo;s the question most asked: &amp;lsquo;How does a MINA based application look like&amp;rsquo;? In this article lets see what&amp;rsquo;s the architecture of MINA based application. Have tried to gather the information from presentations based on MINA.
A Bird&amp;rsquo;s Eye View:
Here, we can see that MINA is the glue between your application (be it a client or a server) and the underlying network layer, which can be based on TCP, UDP, in-VM communication or even a RS-232C serial protocol for a client.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch2-basics/ch2.1.1-server-architecture.html</guid>
      <description>2.1.1 - Server Architecture We have exposed the MINA Application Architecture in the previous section. Let&amp;rsquo;s now focus on the Server Architecture. Basically, a Server listens on a port for incoming requests, process them and send replies. It also creates and handles a session for each client (whenever we have a TCP or UDP based protocol), this will be explain more extensively in the chapter 4.
 IOAcceptor listens on the network for incoming connections/packets For a new connection, a new session is created and all subsequent request from IP Address/Port combination are handled in that Session All packets received for a Session, traverses the Filter Chain as specified in the diagram.</description>

      <description>2.1.2 - Client Architecture We had a brief look at MINA based Server Architecture, lets see how Client looks like. Clients need to connect to a Server, send message and process the responses.
 Client first creates an IOConnector (MINA Construct for connecting to Socket), initiates a bind with Server Upon Connection creation, a Session is created and is associated with Connection Application/Client writes to the Session, resulting in data being sent to Server, after traversing the Filter Chain All the responses/messages received from Server are traverses the Filter Chain and lands at IOHandler, for processing  </description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch2-basics/ch2.3-sample-tcp-client.html</guid>
      <description>2.3 - Sample TCP Client We have seen the Client Architecture. Lets explore a sample Client implementation.
We shall use Sumup Client as a reference implementation.
We will remove boiler plate code and concentrate on the important constructs. Below the code for the Client :
public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable { NioSocketConnector connector = new NioSocketConnector(); connector.setConnectTimeoutMillis(CONNECT_TIMEOUT); if (USE_CUSTOM_CODEC) { connector.getFilterChain().addLast(&amp;#34;codec&amp;#34;, new ProtocolCodecFilter(new SumUpProtocolCodecFactory(false))); } else { connector.getFilterChain().addLast(&amp;#34;codec&amp;#34;, new ProtocolCodecFilter(new ObjectSerializationCodecFactory())); } connector.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch2-basics/ch2.4-sample-udp-server.html</guid>
      <description>2.4 - Sample UDP Server We will begin by looking at the code found in the org.apache.mina.example.udp package. To keep life simple, we shall concentrate on MINA related constructs only.
To construct the server, we shall have to do the following:
 Create a Datagram Socket to listen for incoming Client requests (See MemoryMonitor.java) Create an IoHandler to handle the MINA framework generated events (See MemoryMonitorHandler.java)  Here is the first snippet that addresses Point# 1:</description>

      <description>2.5 -Sample UDP Client Lets look at the client code for the UDP Server from previous section.
To implement the Client we need to do following:
 Create Socket and Connect to Server Set the IoHandler Collect free memory Send the Data to the Server  We will begin by looking at the file MemMonClient.java, found in the org.apache.mina.example.udp.client java package. The first few lines of the code are simple and straightforward.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch3-service/ch3.1-io-service.html</guid>
      <description>3.1 - IoService Introduction IoService provides basic I/O Service and manages I/O Sessions within MINA. Its one of the most crucial part of MINA Architecture. The implementing classes of IoService and child interface, are where most of the low level I/O operations are handled.
IoService Mind Map Let&amp;rsquo;s try to see what are the responsibilities of the IoService and it implementing class AbstractIoService. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a slightly different approach of first using a Mind Map and then jump into the inner working.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch3-service/ch3.2-io-service-details.html</guid>
      <description>3.2 - IoService Details IoService is an interface that is implemented by the two most important classes in MINA :
 IoAcceptor IoConnector  In order to build a server, you need to select an implementation of the IoAcceptor interface. For client applications, you need to implement an implementation of the IoConnector interface.
IoAcceptor Basically, this interface is named because of the accept() method, responsible for the creation of new connections between a client and the server.</description>

      <description>3.3 - Acceptor In order to build a server, you need to select an implementation of the IoAcceptor interface.
IoAcceptor Basically, this interface is named because of the accept() method, responsible for the creation of new connections between a client and the server. The server accepts incoming connections request.
At some point, we could have named this interface &amp;lsquo;Server&amp;rsquo;.
As we may deal with more than one kind of transport (TCP/UDP/&amp;hellip;), we have more than one implementation for this interface.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch3-service/ch3.4-connector.html</guid>
      <description>3.4 - Connector For client applications, you need to implement an implementation of the IoConnector interface.
IoConnector As we have to use an IoAcceptor for servers, you have to implement the IoConnector. Again, we have many implementation classes :
 NioSocketConnector : the non-blocking Socket transport Connector NioDatagramConnector : the non-blocking UDP transport * Connector* AprSocketConnector : the blocking Socket transport * Connector*, based on APR ProxyConnector : a Connector providing proxy support SerialConnector : a Connector for a serial transport VmPipeConnector : the in-VM * Connector*  Just pick the one that fit your need.</description>

      <description>4.1 - Session Configuration Depending on the Session&amp;rsquo;s type, we can configure various elements. Some of those elements are shared across all the session&amp;rsquo;s type, some other are specific.
We currently support 4 session flavors :
 Socket : support for the TCP transport Datagram : support for the UDP transport Serial : support for the RS232 transport VmPipe : support for the IPC transport  General parameters Here is the list of all the global parameters (they can be set fo any of the Session flavors) :</description>

      <description>4.2 - Session Statistics We keep some statistics in each sessions about what&amp;rsquo;s going on. Not all those statistics are computed fr every message though : some of them are computed on demand.
   Parameter type Description automatic     readBytes long The total number of bytes read since the session was created yes   readBytesThroughput double The number of bytes read per second in the last interval no   readMessages long The total number of messages read since the session was created yes   readMessagesThroughput double The number of messages read per second in the last interval no   scheduledWriteBytes AtomicInteger The number of bytes waiting to be written yes   scheduledWriteMessages AtomicInteger The number of messages waiting to be written yes   writtenBytes long The total number of bytes written since the session was created yes   writtenBytesThroughput double The number of bytes written per second in the last interval no   writtenMessages long The total number of messages written since the session was created yes   writtenMessagesThroughput double The number of messages written per second in the last interval no    All those parameters can be read using getters.</description>

      <description>5.1 - Blacklist Filter This filter blocks connections from blacklisted remote addresses. One can block Addresses or Subnets. In any case, when an event happens on a blocked session, the session will simply be closed. Here are the events this filter handles :
 event (MINA 2.1) messageReceived messageSent sessionCreated sessionIdle sessionOpened  There is no need to handle any other event.
Blocking an address Any address or subnet can be blocked live, ie it does not matter if a session is already active or not, this dynamically activated.</description>

      <description>5.19 - SSL/TLS Filter This is a critical part of any serious network application: securing the communication between the client and the server.
In MINA, we do that with the SslFilter. The idea is to add this Filter in the chain and it will deal with the Handshake negociation, and the following encrypting and uncrypting of the data.
How it works The thing to remember is that the TLS protocol works in two steps:</description>

      <description>5.3 - Compression Filter The CompressionFilter class is used to compress data before it gets sent and decompress it when it&amp;rsquo;s received. It uses the JZLIB library.
It only handles two events :
 messageReceived: The received message will be decompressed, if it&amp;rsquo;s contained in a IoBuffer. filterWrite: The message to write will be compressed, assuming it&amp;rsquo;s stored in a IoBuffer (otherwise an exception will be generated).  Configuration It&amp;rsquo;s possible to configure the CompressionFilter, with the listed parameters :</description>

      <description>Our project uses JIRA, a Java EE based issue tracking and project management application, and GitHub as an alternative for some subprojects.
Use either one, but please don&amp;rsquo;t file the same issue at both.
If neither option is suitable for you, issues can also be reported via e-mail as a last resort.
General guidance First, this is the best place to submit bugs (or what you think is a bug). The mailing list is a short term memory place, don&amp;rsquo;t expect your problem to be answered if it&amp;rsquo;s not in the next couple of days you posted on it.</description>

      <description>Chapter 10 - Executor Filter MINA 1.X version let the user define the Thread Model at the Acceptor level. It was part of the Acceptor configuration. This led to complexity, and the MINA team decided to remove this option, replacing it with a much more versatile system, based on a filter : the ExecutorFilter.
The ExecutorFilter class This class is implementing the IoFilter interface, and basically, it contains an Executor to spread the incoming events to a pool of threads.</description>

      <description>Chapter 11 - SSL Filter The SslFilter is the filter in charge of managing the encryption and decryption of data sent through a secured connection. Whenever you need to establish a secured connection, or to transform an existing connection to make it secure, you have to add the SslFilter in your filter chain.
As any session can modify it&amp;rsquo;s message filter chain at will, it allows for protocols like startTLS to be used on an opened connection.</description>

      <description>Chapter 14 - State Machine If you are using MINA to develop an application with complex network interactions you may at some point find yourself reaching for the good old State pattern to try to sort out some of that complexity. However, before you do that you might want to checkout mina-statemachine which tries to address some of the shortcomings of the State pattern.
 A simple example   Lookup a StateContext object Convert the method invocation into an Event object Invoke the StateMachine Execute the Transition   State inheritance Error handling using state inheritance mina-statemachine with IoHandler   Changing state programmatically Calling the state machine recursively   A simple example Let&amp;rsquo;s demonstrate how mina-statemachine works with a simple example.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2 - Basics In Chapter 1, we had a brief glimpse of Apache MINA. In this chapter we shall have a look at Client/Server Architecture and details on working out a MINA based Server and Client.
We will also expose some very simple Servers and Clients, based on TCP and UDP.
 2.1 - Application Architecture  2.1.1 - Server Architecture 2.1.2 - Client Architecture   2.3 - Sample TCP Client 2.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3 - IoService A MINA IoService - as seen in the application architecture chapter, is the base class supporting all the IO services, either from the server side or the client side.
It will handle all the interaction with your application, and with the remote peer, send and receive messages, manage sessions, connections, etc.
It&amp;rsquo;s an interface, which is implemented as an IoAcceptor for the server side, and IoConnector for the client side.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4 - Session  4.1 - Session Configuration 4.2 - Session Statistics  Introduction The Session is at the heart of MINA : every time a client connects to the server, a new session is created on the server, and will be kept in memory until the client is disconnected. If you are using MINA on the client side, every time you connect to a server, a session will be created on the client too.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6 - Internals Creating a FtpServer instance is done using a FtpServerFactory. The is done with such code:
FtpServerFactory serverFactory = new FtpServerFactory(); FtpServer server = serverFactory.createServer(); server.start(); ... Let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens when we create the factory and when the server is created
FtpServerFactory creation The FtpServerFactory is associated with a FtpServerContext instance, which defines a set of elements:
 a CommandFactory instance a ConnectionConfig instance a FileSystemFactory instance a FtpletContainer instance a FtpStatistics instance a set of Listener instances a MessageResource instance.</description>

IoHandler has following functions
 sessionCreated sessionOpened sessionClosed sessionIdle exceptionCaught messageReceived messageSent  sessionCreated Event Session Created event is fired when a new connection is created. For TCP its the result of connection accept, and for UDP this is generated when a UDP packet is received.</description>

      <description>Chapter 8 - IoBuffer A byte buffer used by MINA applications.
This is a replacement for ByteBuffer. MINA does not use NIO ByteBuffer directly for two reasons:
 It doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide useful getters and putters such as fill, get/putString, and get/putAsciiInt() . It is difficult to write variable-length data due to its fixed capacity  This will change in MINA 3. The main reason why MINA has its own wrapper on top of nio ByteBuffer is to have extensible buffers.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/userguide/ch9-codec-filter/ch9-codec-filter.html</guid>
      <description>Chapter 9 - Codec Filter This tutorial tries to explain why and how to use a ProtocolCodecFilter.
Why use a ProtocolCodecFilter?  TCP guarantees delivery of all packets in the correct order. But there is no guarantee that one write operation on the sender-side will result in one read event on the receiving side. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Fragmentation_and_reassembly and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm In MINA terminology: without a ProtocolCodecFilter one call of IoSession.write(Object message) by the sender can result in multiple messageReceived(IoSession session, Object message) events on the receiver; and multiple calls of IoSession.</description>

      <description>Embed into another application About logging Embedding software making use of logging into another one making use of logging itself can be cumbersome. Vysper uses slf4j for logging, which foremost is a logging facade. The actual logging worker is then bound at runtime. It can be log4j, as in standalone Vysper, or some other logging framework. If you make use of one of these in your embedding application, just put the proper slf4j adapter lib onto the classpath.</description>

      <description>FtpServer and port 21 on Linux Under Linux only programs running as root is allowed to bind and listen to ports with port numbers below 1024. However, running a server which communicates with untrusted clients as root is not recommended for security reasons. The standard way to solve this problem in servers such as Apache HTTPD is to start the server as root and bind to the privileged port and then use the setuid C function to change the user ID of the current process.</description>

All the configuration parameters are grouped depending on the component where it has been used. The configuration format is XML based and comes with a matching XML Schema that can be used in XML editors to simplify configuration.
The XML document scaffold looks like this:

      <description>Configure passive ports When the client wants to use a passive data connection, the server should provide the port to use. By default, FtpServer will choose any available port. However this can be overridden using the configuration for the passive data connection. The allowed passive ports can then be specified as a single port (e.g. 20020), multiple ports (e.g. 20020, 20030, 20040) or a range of ports (e.g. 20020-20030). Ranges can be closed (e.</description>

      <description>Database user manager You can store user user information in a database. JDBC is used to access the database. This user manager has been tested using MySQL, HSQLDB and FireBird database. All the user information is stored in FTP_USER table. An example DDL file for the database is provided in &amp;lt;INSTALL_DIR&amp;gt;/res/ftp-db.sql.
Database JDBC libraries You must include the required JAR files for your database in the classpath of FtpServer. Typically you would do this by placing the JAR files in &amp;lt;INSTALL_DIR&amp;gt;/common/lib.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/ftpserver-project/ftplet.html</guid>
      <description>Ftplet Overview The Ftplet API is a simple API used to handle different FtpServer notifications. Apache FtpServer is a Ftplet container, allowing administrators to deploy Ftplet to carry out a variety of complex FTP event handler tasks.
Implementing a custom Ftplet is generally a simple task, most of whose complexity lies in coding the actual work to be done by the Ftplet. This is largely due to the simplicity of the Ftplet interface and the fact that a DefaultFtplet class is provided as part of the Ftplet package.</description>

      <description>Overview Sources for the Apache MINA projects are currently managed through GIT. Instructions on GIT use can be found at http://git-scm.com/book/.
Normal Git Access Anyone can check code out of Git. You only need to specify a username and password in order to update the Git repository, and only MINA committers have the permissions to do that. We run Git over standard HTTPS, so hopefully you won&amp;rsquo;t have problems with intervening firewalls.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Apache FtpServer Overview The Apache FtpServer is a 100% pure Java FTP server. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be a complete and portable FTP server engine solution based on currently available open protocols. FtpServer can be run standalone as a Windows service or Unix/Linux daemon, or embedded into a Java application. We also provide support for integration within Spring applications and provide our releases as OSGi bundles.
The default network support is based on Apache MINA, a high performance asynchronous IO library.</description>

Typical server set up : &amp;lt;INSTALL_DIR&amp;gt;/res/conf/ftpd-typical.xml
 Full example configuration file : &amp;lt;INSTALL_DIR&amp;gt;/res/conf/ftpd-full.xml If you want to use your own jar files, you can put those jar files in system CLASSPATH or copy those jar files in the &amp;lt;INSTALL_DIR&amp;gt;/common/lib directory.  To run the server, go to &amp;lt;INSTALL_DIR&amp;gt; directory and execute ftpd.bat (if Windows) or ftpd.</description>

      <description>Listeners Listeners are the component in FtpServer which is responsible for listening on the network socket and when clients connect create the user session, execute commands and so on. An FtpServer can have multiple listeners at the same time, some examples include:
 one listener on port 21 (the default option) one cleartext listener on port 21 and one for implicit SSL on port 22 one cleartext listener in an internal IP address only and one for implicit SSL for the external IP address  Listeners are identified by a name, the default listener is identified by &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/ftpserver-project/configuration_logging.html</guid>
      <description>Logging FtpServer Logging FtpServer uses SLF4J throughout its internal code allowing the developer to choose a logging configuration that suits their needs, e.g java.util.logging or Log4J. SLF4J provides FtpServer the ability to log hierarchically across various log levels without needing to rely on a particular logging implementation.
MDC logging FtpServer supports MDC logging. Basically, it provides session based information for the logger. Of primary interest in the case of FtpServer are the user name and remote IP address for each session.</description>

      <description>Managing users Since FtpServer user manager might encrypt user passwords before saving them, manually administering the user database can be hard. There is basically three ways:
Manually Using either the PropertiesUserManager or DbUserManager you can access the data store (file or database) directly to edit users. For clear text passwords you can simply edit them. For MD5 hashed passwords, you can you use any of the available MD5 tools, for example http://www.</description>

      <description>User Manager Built in user managers FtpServer comes with two different user managers:
 File based user manager Database user manager  Custom User Manager You can write your own user manager to integrate it with your existing applications. Your custom user manager should implement org.apache.ftpserver.ftplet.UserManager interface. In your configuration file, you will have to use the Spring bean element to configure your custom user manager. This gives you all the power of Spring, for example integrating with your other beans.</description>

      <description>Installing FtpServer as a Windows service Install Apache FtpServer can be installed as a Windows service using the following command:
&amp;lt;install dir&amp;gt;bin\service install  This will create a service called Apache FtpServer that can be started and stopped as a usual service.
As a second parameter, the service identifier can be provided. This would normally be used if multiple FtpServer services should be installed, for example:
&amp;lt;install dir&amp;gt;bin\service install ftpd2  Without any further options, this will use the default configuration.</description>

      <description>Message flow When a selector receives some OP_READ event, the associated IoProcessor is awaken and starts to process this event. It all starts with reading the channel, then pushing the read data through the filter chain down to the IoHandler (aka, the application). If the application decides to write back a response, it goes through the chain again, andultimately the data to be pushed into the channel is pushed into a queue (_writeRequestQueue), then the stack is unfolled, down to the IoProcessor, which pops the data from the queue and writes it into the channel.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/2.1-vs-2.0.html</guid>
      <description>2.1.x vs 2.0.x differences The way an application is informed that a session has been secured (ie, the SSL/TLS handshake has been successfully completed) was to use a notification system. A specific message was pushed for that purpose, up to the client application to check that message. It forced the application implementer to inject a special session attribute (SslFilter.USE_NOTIFICATION), which is a bit heavy.
It was decided to change that and make it easier for the application to get this information.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/2.2-vs-2.1.html</guid>
      <description>2.2.x vs 2.1.x differences The SSL/TLS handling has been totally rewritten in MINA 2.2. This has an impact in many areas.
Removal of the SslFilter.DISABLE_ENCRYPTION_ONCE attribute This attribute was used in previous MINA versions to insure that we can send a clear text message to the remote peer while establishing the TLS connection when using the startTLS command.
The idea is that the startTLS command is sent by an application (an LDAP client, for instance), which tells the server it should establish the SSL/TLS layer.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Apache MINA Overview Apache MINA is a network application framework which helps users develop high performance and high scalability network applications easily. It provides an abstract &amp;middot; event-driven &amp;middot; asynchronous API over various transports such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP via Java NIO.
Apache MINA is often called:
 NIO framework &amp;middot; library, client &amp;middot; server framework &amp;middot; library, or a networking &amp;middot; socket library.  However, it&amp;rsquo;s much more than that.</description>

      <title>SSHD Overview</title>

      <description>Overview Apache MINA SSHD is a 100% pure java library to support the SSH protocols on both the client and server side. It does not aim at being a replacement for the SSH client or SSH server from Unix operating systems, but rather provides support for Java based applications requiring SSH support.
The library can leverage several I/O back-ends:
 The default transport is built-in and uses Java&amp;rsquo;s AsynchronousSocketChannels. Apache MINA, a scalable and high performance asynchronous I/O library, can be used instead, or the Netty asynchronous event-driven network framework is also supported.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/sshd-project/sources.html</guid>
      <description>Overview Sources for the Apache MINA projects are currently managed through Git. Instructions on Git use can be found at the official Git site.
Normal Git Access Anyone can check code out of Git. You only need to specify a username and password in order to update the Git repository, and only MINA committers have the permissions to do that. We run Git over standard HTTPS, so hopefully you won&amp;rsquo;t have problems with intervening firewalls.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/mina-project/technical-documentation/ssl-tls-internal.html</guid>
      <description>SSL/TLS internals This is a technical description of how SSL/TLS are handled in MINA. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to read this to have it working, better have a look at the SslFilter user guide page. However, if you want to get a deeper understanding on how it&amp;rsquo;s built, this is the place !
Note: We will assume the MINA API user has already created the SSLContext to use, so it&amp;rsquo;s not part of those explanations.</description>

      <description>Marko Asplund says:
 I found that Apache MINA really did fulfill its promise and implementing a high-performance, scalable and extensible network server was easy using it. MINA also helps very cleanly separate network communication and application level message processing logic. Supporting multiple different protocols in in the same server is well supported in MINA. As a downside the documentation for v2.0 is a bit lacking, but fortunately there are quite a few code samples that you can check out.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/vysper-project/extending_server.html</guid>
      <description>How to extend the server functionality XMPP support for extensions XMPP provides a bunch of already specified extensions. See http://www.xmpp.org/extensions for a complete list.
XMPP also allows for custom extensions of the core stanza types &amp;lsquo;message&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;iq&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;presence&amp;rsquo;. All XMPP clients and servers should be able to savely ignore them unless they are able to deal with them. See the relevant specification chapter.
Most XMPP extensions rely on Disco (Service Discovery, XEP-0030).</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/vysper-project/server_to_server_comm.html</guid>
      <description>Server-to-server Available since version 0.7.  XMPP servers like Apache Vysper work in federated networks much like SMTP servers. Users connect to their own server, and when communicating with users on a different domain, the two servers will connect to each other and exchange XMPP stanzas. Server-to-server (S2S) connections differ from client-to-server (C2) connections in that stanzas for multiple users might be sent over the same connection. S2S connections are similar to C2S connections from the point that one of the servers serves as an initiator, like a client.</description>

      <description>Using Service Discovery Disco quick start Service Discovery (or &amp;lsquo;disco&amp;rsquo;) is a XMPP extensions specified at (Service Discovery, XEP-0030).
Disco resembles Directory services like LDAP, or even file systems.
Disco is a server-side service. It maintains a tree of nodes (branches) and items (leafs). Clients discover child nodes and items of the root node or some other already discovered node by sending info-requests (IQ stanzas). The server replies with a IQ response containing a list of nodes and items.</description>

      <description>SOCKS5 bytestream module Available since version 0.7.  The Vysper SOCKS5 Bytestream module implements mediated connections from XEP-0065 SOCKS5 Bytestream. Direct connections requires no support from the server and thus works without this module. For mediated connections, this module will supply a SOCKS5 proxy that transfers data between the requester and target clients. The module also provides all the required service discovery support used to negotiate the address of the SOCKS5 proxy.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/vysper-project/stanza_processing_layer.html</guid>
      <description>Stanza Processing Commands in the XMPP world are called Stanzas.
At the transport layer, when going over the net between client and server, they have a textual representation in XML.
In Vysper, the Stanza processing layer only deals with Stanza java objects. They are created by the transport layer, or using Builder utility classes from within Vysper. That makes this layer independent from any underlying transport layer. Stanzas are directly injectable on this level.</description>

      <description>User Management Apache Vysper comes with very basic user management support out of the box. But, frequently you would rather want to integrate Vysper with your already existing authentication solution. To enable this, Vysper comes with a simple API to implement your own authentication and user management.
Authentication UserAuthentication is the interface which will get called when a client authenticates itself using SASL. Vysper currently ships with two implementations, one in-memory and one based on JCR.</description>

      <guid>https://mina.apache.org/vysper-project/test_client.html</guid>
      <description>Using the test client The test clients builds on the XMPP client library Smack. It takes two parameters:
 login name for the &amp;lsquo;from&amp;rsquo; user login name for the &amp;lsquo;to&amp;rsquo; user  The domain is assumed to be &amp;lsquo;vysper.org&amp;rsquo;, the password to be &amp;lsquo;password1&amp;rsquo;. This relates to the default users correctly configured in the default spring configuration file.
The client logs into the server with the &amp;lsquo;from&amp;rsquo; user login and starts to send messages to the &amp;lsquo;to&amp;rsquo; user.</description>

      <title>Vysper Websocket endpoint</title>

      <description>Websocket endpoint Available since version 0.7.  While websockets are still being specified, a draft specification for XMPP over websockets has been published at http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-moffitt-xmpp-over-websocket-00. Websockets enables web browsers to establish duplex communications with servers with very little overhead.
Vysper provides a websocket endpoint. The easiest way to use the endpoint is to simply add it as a regular endpoint:
XMPPServer server = new XMPPServer(&amp;#34;vysper.org&amp;#34;); server.addEndpoint(new TCPEndpoint()); server.addEndpoint(new WebSocketEndpoint()); server.start(); That’s it.</description>

      <title>Vysper XM Processing</title>

      <description>XML Processing XML data is the payload of the XMPP protocol. More precisely, XMPP only works on a subset of XML. See RFC3920 for details.
The core handler and protocol code does not deal with xml strings directly. They only deal with java objects representing well-formed XMPP commands, called stanzas.
To create these objects, the actual XML is processed in stages at the xml processing layer.
While raw XML continues streaming in, we are faced with arbitrary partitioned stanza and even partial xml.</description>
