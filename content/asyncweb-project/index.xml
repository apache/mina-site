      <description>Apache AsyncWeb The **AsyncWeb** project is currently dormant. We don&#39;t have committers for it, so if you feel like you can give an hand, please do contact us !  Apache AsyncWeb (built on top of the Apache MINA network framework) employs non-blocking selector driven IO at the transport level, and is asynchronous throughout - from the initial parsing of requests, right through to and including the services implemented by users.</description>

      <description>Sources for the Apache AsyncWeb projects are currently managed through Subversion (SVN). Instructions on Subversion use can be found at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/. If you are on Windows, the excellent TortoiseSVN client is highly recommended.
For each project you can find a detailed description how to checkout and build the source on the project documentation. This page is just a short overview.
Web Access to Subversion If you just want to browse the source code, you can use the web interface to Subversion.</description>
